# GUI Alarm Using Python

Creating a GUI alarm using Python involves building a graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to set alarms at specific times and have the program trigger an action (e.g., play a sound or display a message) when the alarm time is reached. Here's a brief description of the key components and steps involved in creating a GUI alarm in Python:


## Features

- Set alarms for specific times.
- Customize alarm actions, including playing sounds or displaying messages.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Cross-platform compatibility (works on Windows, macOS, and Linux).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.
- Required Python libraries, including Tkinter, pygame,datetime,time, (for sound playback).

## Installation
1. Install the required Python libraries:

2. Run the application:


## Customization

You can customize the alarm sound by replacing the default "ringtone.mp3" file in the project directory with your own sound file. Ensure the sound file is in a compatible format (e.g., MP3) and update the file path in the code accordingly.
